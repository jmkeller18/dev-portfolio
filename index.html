    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Thanks for coming to check out my portfolio! I started going to school for web development in the spring of 2023, so
      this is definitely a work in progress, but I hope you are able to see my potential in what I have here so far. I have absolutely loved programming since the very beginning of when I started pursuing this career, so I know it won't be long before this portfolio has more content which is also more advanced, but in the meantime I hope you enjoy the projects I've included below. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions you might have. </p>

  <h2>My Projects:</h2>
  <div class="projects-container">
    <div>
      <h3>Kinetiplants</h3>
      <a href="kinetiplants/index.html" target="_blank">Go To Website</a>

      <h4>Background:</h4>
      <p>This website was the result of a final project for one of my classes. The instructions were to create a fake
        business and make a website for that business. The product/service that the business offered wasn't required to
        be a real thing that already exists, so I decided to take the opportunity to be creative and came up with a
        company that sells plants with electrodes in them which allow the user to add custom movements to the plants.

      <h3>Pizza Party</h3>
      <a href="pizza-party/index.html" target="_blank">Go To Website</a>

      <h4>Background:</h4>
      <p>Another result of a final project, this time for my scripting class, the focus here was solely JavaScript,
        though I wanted to add styles to make it look nice as well. The instructions were to make a fully functional
        pizza ordering application, which is what you will see here.
