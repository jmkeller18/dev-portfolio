          <p>Welcome, and may we present to you the thrilling new world of plants! Here at
            KinetiPlants, with the help of
            some groundbreaking science, we have taken the ordinary houseplant and given it the power of motion. Having
            the ability to move continuously all day and in a controlled fashion, the leaves and stems of a KinetiPlant
            can perform all kinds of motions including: twisting, curling, unfurling, pulsing, and undulating (wavy
            motion).
          </p>
          <p>While traditional houseplants are beautiful in their own right, with a KinetiPlant in your home, you won't
            be
            able to take your eyes away from the spectacle of a show our plants put on for you. It's an incredibly
            exciting
            time to be a plant lover, now pick up your very own KinetiPlant today and see what you've been missing out
            on!

      <h3>The Technology</h3>
      <div class="mpi-flex-container">
        <img src="images/icon-tech.png" alt="tech icon">
        <p>The science behind our products is truly fascinating. It all revolves around our patented microscopic
          electrode system. This system of electrodes is inserted into the stems and veins of our plants, where they
          act very similarly to our central nervous system. The electrodes then send electrical impulses to the plant
          which, in turn, generates the movement you see before your very own eyes.</p>

      <h3>Customization</h3>
      <div class="mpi-flex-container">
        <img src="images/icon-customize.png" alt="gear icon">
        <p>The best part about your KinetiPlant is that you decide how and when the plant moves. While we do include
          several different presets to get you going right away, ultimately you can tailor every aspect of your plant's
          movements to your liking. With our app, you can change a movement's type, location, tempo, and repeat rate.
          You can even program the plant to move to the beat of a song and set up automations so your plant behaves
          differently throughout the day. The possibilities are endless!

      <h3>Grows With The Plant</h3>
      <div class="mpi-flex-container">
        <img src="images/icon-growth.png" alt="plant icon">
        <p>You may be wondering, will my KinetiPlant grow like a traditional plant? The answer is Yes! KinetiPlants grow
          and act just like normal plants. The only difference, of course, is our plants' ability to captivate you with
          motion. The breakthrough engineering behind our electrode systems allows them to scale with the plant's growth
          and actually create new electrodes - so no need to worry about pruning your plant. Prune your heart out!</p>

      <h3>Solar Powered</h3>
      <div class="mpi-flex-container">
        <img src="images/icon-solar.png" alt="sun icon">
        <p>While the electrical system that lives inside of a KinetiPlant does in fact need to get its power from
          somewhere, you won't find any batteries here. Instead, we turn to the power of the sun. While your plant is
          absorbing the sun's energy, our solar inserts are doing the same. The inserts are probed into the soil where
          they transfer electricity to a metal receptor plate at the base of the pot, while its compact panel resides
          subtly on the surface of the soil. You'll honestly forget it's even there!
